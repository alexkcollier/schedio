      Interaction states communicate the status of components and interactive elements. These states should be visibly distinct, but the element should still be recognizable.
      Interactive elements should whether or not they are interactive and provide feedback upon interaction. Feedback should be provided as to the outcome of that interaction.

    <p>
      Motion and animation help smooth and clarify the transitions between states. They should never impede the usability or accessibility of a product when used correctly.
