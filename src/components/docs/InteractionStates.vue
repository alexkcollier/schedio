    <BaseHeading level="1">
      Interaction
    </BaseHeading>
    <p>
      Interaction states visually communicate the status of components and interactive elements. These states should be visibly distinct, but the element should still be recognizable.
    </p>

    <BaseHeading level="2">
      Motion &amp; Animation
    </BaseHeading>
    <p>
      Motion and animation can be used to clarify and communicate that an element's state has changed. They also help make these transitions less jarring.
